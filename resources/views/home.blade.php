            Children, much like seeds, are an investment that can yield exponential return. Providing Preventative

                <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
            <p>Providing P.R.O.O.F. is an economic wealth source that situates valuation processes as the roots to sow
                economic literacy within young people to reduce economic disparity. Providing P.R.O.O.F. operates from a
                framework of abundance and promotes the cultivation of knowledge, the participation in investment processes,
                the sharing of resources, and the revision of beliefs and actions to harvest transformative economic agencies and
                diverse thriving economies that will be passed on as wealth to future generations. We establish roots of
                sustenance and spread seeds that bear crops for long term benefits though Economically Relevant Pedagogies
                and Critical Design frameworks; fostering the fruit of mindful transformations leading to fully realized authentic
                individual and collective economies.
